# Discrete-Mathematics-Relations
In this code you give the a set of A to make your A x A set and 2 relations and give their attributes.



if you wanna Enter a set for A you should only enter numbers ! 
For example : A={ 1 , 2 , 3 } ==> input : 1 2 3 
And for relations , if you wanna enter a pair you should do the same ! 
For example : R={ ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 2 , 2 ) , ( 3 , 1 ) } ==> input : 1 2    2 2    3 1
